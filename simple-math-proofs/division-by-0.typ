= Proving $n/0$ is not $infinity$
The inverse of division is multiplication, so:
$ 6 / 2 = 3 $
$ 3 * 2 = 6 $

So if we pretend for a moment that $n/0 = infinity$, then the following is true (where $n$ is any number):
$ n / 0 = infinity $
$ infinity * 0 = n $

However, a fundemental rule in multiplication is that anything times $0$ is $0$ (as you have 0 groups of $n$), so $infinity * 0 eq.not n$, thus proving that anything divided by $0$ is not infinity.

= Proving $0/0$ is undefined
Let $alpha = 1 * 0$ and $beta = 2 * 0$. As anything times $0$ is $0$, $alpha = beta$. Now let's set up the following equation:
$ alpha = beta $

Expanded, this would be:
$ 1 * 0 = 2 * 0 $

So far so good. Now let's try dividing $0$ on both sides:
$ (1 * 0) / 0 = (2 * 0) / 0 $

If we pretend for a moment that $0/0$ is defined, then the following occurs:
$ (1 * cancel(0)) / cancel(0) = (2 * cancel(0)) / cancel(0) $

Leaving:
$ 1 = 2 $

For obvious reasons this is false, but just to prove it is false, if $1 = 2$, then the following can be concluded:
$ 1 + 1 = 1 $
$ 1 + cancel(1 + (-1)) = cancel(1 + (-1)) $
$ 1 + 0 = 0 $
$ 1 = 0 $
