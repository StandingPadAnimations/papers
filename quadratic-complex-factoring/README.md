This is a very basic document on a method of factoring quadratics where no real solutions exist. The method documented here was found after some brute forcing on my part. From what I've been told, it's an already known method, but I'm putting it here anyway.

This method only works for quadratics in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a=1$.
