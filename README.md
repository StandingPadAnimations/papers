This is a collection of all of my papers that I've written with https://github.com/typst/typst. Each folder has the source files for a single paper

To build a paper, open a terminal and go into the source folder of the paper in question, then type:
```sh
typst compile <name_of_paper>.typ
```

The output will be saved as `<name_of_paper>.pdf`.
